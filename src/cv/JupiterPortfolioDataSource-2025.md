## **🚀 Professional Experience**

### **🏢 TESCO**

Location: London, UK  
Timeline: May 2023 – Present  
Official Title: Software Development Engineer III  
Functional Role: Staff Engineer / Platform Lead

#### **🔹 Project 1: Internal Developer Platform (IDP)**

*Building the "Golden Path" for thousands of Tesco engineers.*

* **Description:** A secure, multi-tenant platform that abstracts infrastructure complexity, allowing product teams to provision standardized cloud resources in minutes rather than days.  
* **Core Tech:** Golang Terraform Azure DevOps React Docker PostgreSQL  
* **Key Features Built:**  
  * Automated scaffolding of microservices with built-in security compliance.  
  * Seamless integration with Azure DevOps for instant CI/CD pipeline generation.  
  * Self-service portal for managing cloud resources (Databases, Cache, Compute).

**🏆 Leadership Challenge: Customer Obsession & Invent and Simplify**

* **The Challenge:** Engineers were overwhelmed by the complexity of disparate cloud tools and security compliance requirements. Onboarding a new service took days of manual configuration, leading to frustration and "Shadow IT."  
* **The Action:** I treated internal engineers as my "Customers." I conducted user research to understand their friction points. Instead of just writing backend scripts, I championed a UX-first approach, designing a UI that simplified complex Terraform modules into a "Shopping Cart" experience for infrastructure.  
* **The Result:** drastically reduced onboarding time and configuration errors. The recorded demos and documentation I created bridged the gap between Ops and Dev, driving widespread adoption.

#### **🔹 Project 2: Cloud Migration & Cost Optimization**

*Optimization of the Recommendations, Substitutions & Lists domain.*

* **Description:** Strategic migration of high-traffic backend services from legacy AWS setups to optimized Azure architecture.  
* **Core Tech:** Java 21 Spring Boot Virtual Threads Kafka Azure AKS Redis

**🏆 Leadership Challenge: Frugality & Ownership**

* **The Challenge:** The domain was suffering from bloated cloud resource usage and high latency in data synchronization between user devices (e.g., App vs. Web).  
* **The Action:** I performed a deep-dive audit of the infrastructure. I identified over-provisioned resources and architected a migration plan to Azure. Simultaneously, I drove the architectural shift to Event-Driven Architecture (Kafka) to handle real-time state syncing.  
* **The Result:** Delivered **£440,000** in confirmed annual savings and enabled real-time collaborative ordering functionality.

### **🏢 APERZA INC.**

Location: Yokohama, Japan  
Timeline: Nov 2017 – Oct 2022  
Role: Technical Lead  
Context: B2B Manufacturing Marketplace (Series B Startup)

#### **🔹 Project 1: Infrastructure Modernization (EC2 to ECS)**

*Scaling the core E-commerce platform.*

* **Description:** Moving the monolithic and service-based architecture from manually managed EC2 instances to containerized orchestration.  
* **Core Tech:** AWS ECS (Fargate) Docker Terraform CloudWatch Spot Instances

**🏆 Leadership Challenge: Frugality & Bias for Action**

* **The Challenge:** As traffic grew, the legacy EC2 infrastructure became expensive and brittle. Scaling up for traffic spikes was slow and manual.  
* **The Action:** I led the migration to AWS ECS Fargate. I specifically architected the use of **Spot Instances** for non-critical workloads to maximize savings without compromising uptime.  
* **The Result:** Reduced monthly infrastructure costs by **£2,000 (\~£24k/year)** while improving system resilience and auto-scaling capabilities.

#### **🔹 Project 2: DevOps Culture Transformation**

* **Description:** Moving the engineering team from manual deployments to full CI/CD automation.  
* **Core Tech:** CircleCI GitHub Actions Shell Scripting SonarQube

**🏆 Leadership Challenge: Insist on Highest Standards**

* **The Challenge:** The team was releasing software once every two weeks. Deployments took 4 hours of manual effort, leading to a fear of releasing and large "blast radius" for bugs.  
* **The Action:** I implemented the "Click Button Deployment" initiative. I introduced rigorous TDD (Test Driven Development) and automated the pipeline.  
* **The Result:** Slashed deployment time from **4 hours to 15 minutes**. Enabled the team to release multiple times a day with confidence.

#### **🔹 Project 3: Aperza TV & Vertical SaaS**

* **Description:** Greenfield development of a video streaming service for manufacturing trade shows and a specialized CRM for industry marketing.  
* **Core Tech:** Java, Spring Boot, React, Node
* **Description:** Authored a technical deep-dive on our journey to Continuous Delivery, detailing how we reduced deployment times from 4 hours to 15 minutes. [https://tech.aperza.com/continous-delivery/](https://tech.aperza.com/continous-delivery/)


### **🏢 RAKUTEN ASIA**

Location: Singapore  
Timeline: May 2013 – Apr 2016  
Role: Technical Lead  
Context: Global Tech Giant

#### **🔹 Project: Global Advertising Platform**

* **Description:** A high-throughput ad-serving platform servicing Rakuten ecosystems in Asia, Europe, and Latin America.  
* **Core Tech:** Java Spring Gradle Flyway MySQL Big Data ETL

**🏆 Leadership Challenge: Earn Trust & Deliver Results**

* **The Challenge:** Leading a distributed team (Singapore HQ \+ India Offshore) that suffered from communication silos and inconsistent code quality. Velocity was low due to "merge hell" and manual database syncs.  
* **The Action:** I introduced **Extreme Programming (XP)** practices, specifically Pair Programming and continuous code reviews. I modernized the stack by migrating Ant to Gradle and manual SQL scripts to Flyway for versioning.  
* **The Result:** Improved team velocity by **30%** and successfully launched the platform across three continents on schedule.

### **🏢 NCS PTE LTD**

Location: Singapore  
Timeline: Mar 2011 – Apr 2013  
Role: Application Consultant

#### **🔹 Project 1: Standard Chartered "Straight2Bank"**

* **Description:** Mobile Trade Finance module allowing corporate clients to approve transactions on the go.  
* **Core Tech:** Java EE Web Services (SOAP) Mobile Web Optimization  
* **Key Contribution:** Optimized API payloads to improve transaction processing efficiency by **15%** on constrained mobile networks (3G at the time).

#### **🔹 Project 2: John Wiley & Sons "Access Control"**

* **Description:** Administrative tools for library provisioning and analytics.  
* **Core Tech:** Java SiteCatalyst Google Analytics API

### **🏢 ST. LUKE’S MEDICAL CENTER**

Location: Philippines  
Timeline: May 2009 – Feb 2011  
Role: Team Lead / Senior Java Programmer  
Context: The "Builder" Phase – Architecting core hospital frameworks.

#### **🔹 Project 1: Healthcare Report System (HCR)**

* **Description:** A centralized, asynchronous reporting engine for critical hospital operations (e.g., Gross Revenue, Nursing Reports).  
* **Core Tech:** Java EE JMS (ActiveMQ) Spring MVC JasperReports Oracle DB

**🏆 Leadership Challenge: Invent and Simplify**

* **The Challenge:** Developers were writing repetitive code for queuing, generating, emailing, and printing reports. New reports took days to implement.  
* **The Action:** I architected an abstraction layer over JMS and JasperReports. Developers only needed to write the SQL query; the framework handled queuing, asynchronous generation, and delivery (Email/Printer).  
* **The Result:** Reduced report creation time from days to hours.

#### **🔹 Project 2: Generic File Maintenance System (GFMS)**

* **Description:** A meta-programming framework to automate CRUD operations.  
* **Core Tech:** Java Reflection API Java Generics Hibernate Spring  
* **Key Contribution:** Used Reflection to dynamically generate UI forms and database persistence logic based on entity class definitions. This allowed the team to create "File Maintenance" (CRUD) modules for new database tables without writing explicit controller/service code.

#### **🔹 Project 3: ARMS Middleware (HL7 Interface)**

* **Description:** Integration engine connecting diagnostic machines (CBC, MRI) to the main Hospital Information System.  
* **Core Tech:** HL7 (Health Level 7\) HAPI Mirth Connect Socket Programming  
* **Key Contribution:** Built the parsers to translate raw machine socket data into standardized HL7 messages for the patient database.
